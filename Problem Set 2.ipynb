    "### Introduction\n",
    "You are a data scientist working for the government. You want to understand the public opinion regarding hurricane Maria which is responsible for killing at least 499 people in Puerto Rico. Total losses are estimated at $94.4 billion dollars which accrued to government agencies, businesses, and more importantly, familes [1]. With this background, whether you are a politician, bussiness person, or one effected by the hurricane, understanding the sentiment of the general populace is important. For this assigment, you will use a subset of the tweets retrieved from Twitter that mentioned #PuertoRico over the period of October 4 to November 7, 2017 [2] to measure the sentiment (i.e., the \"good\" or \"bad\" opinions people have about the hurricane and its impact) of this event.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, we will write code for a lexicon-based analysis. Lexicon-based classification is a way to categorize text based using manually generated lists of topical words. Essentially, we just need to check if the topical words appear in a piece of text (e.g., a tweet). In this exercise we will make use of manually curated sentiment words. However, the basic experimental process is the same for other tasks (e.g., identifying offensive language).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested, though it is not needed, you can learn more about lexicon-based classification in Chapter 21 (21.2 and 21.6) of the free online book at the following link: [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/21.pdf)\n",

    "Another limitation is not having a broad enough scope to properly annotate all words, emojis, punctuation, etc. that are deemed positive or negative. A good example of this is tweet 8. The lexicon deemed this as a neutral tweet, but I decided it was positive due to the \"#Donate\", exclamation point, and the heart emoji. Constructing a file that contains all of these nuances would be very time consuming for the individual, as well as computationally challenging for the device classifying the tweets. "
