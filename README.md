# Intro_Sentiment_Classification
Lexicon-based Classification and Supervised Models (SVM) in Python.

This repo contains homework assignments from my Masters of Science in Data Analytics program. These homeworks utilize Python to create the foundation of sentiment analysis. 

 - Problem Set 2 reads in a positive and negative bag of words, creates a Lexicon-based Classifier by calculating sentiment score (positive words - negative words), and identifies limitations to this approach by comparing results to a manual analysis.
 - Problem Set 3 reads in tweets and creates training and testing sets, creates a Lexicon Classifier and tests accuracy, creates a Linear SVC model and tests accuracy, and creates a combined SVC with Lexicon assistance and tests accuracy. I follow this up with manual analysis to validate which approach performs the best and identify limitations of the simple SVC approach.
